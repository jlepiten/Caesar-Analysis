class Cipher:
    """
    Description
    -----------
        Module used for encrypting and decrypting letters in text files using caesar cipher algorithm.
        It is executed using command line interface.

    Concepts covered
    -------- -------
        - Looping
        - Tuples and Dictonaries
        - Conversion of a letter to its ascii value using function ord('<letter>') and vice versa using chr(<ascii number value>)
        - Basic Object Oriented Programming
        - File handling

    Notes
    -----
        - Letter(s) are treated as numbers from 0 - 25 for shifting purpose - letter_number to represent particular letter.
        e.g a or A: letter_number = 0, b or B: letter_number = 1,....z or Z: letter_number = 25
        - To reduce time complexity, dictionaries are predefined instead of using loop for mapping over and over...

    ...

    Attributes
    ----------
        ascii_lower_pos: dict
            it allows lower values of ascii to be mapped to letter number

        ascii_upper_pos: dict
            it allows upper values of ascii to be mapped to letter number

        map_to_ascii: dict
            it allows mapping of letter numbers to both of its lowercase and uppercase ascii values

        file: str
            holds the file object which is to be encrypted or decrypted

    ...

    Methods
    -------
        shift_letter_number(letter_number, key, operation):
            returns new letter number after being shifted by some number of positions (key value)

        cipher_alphabet(letter, key, operation):
            returns rotated alphabet. This method is written such that shift_letter_number works only on letters not characters

        caesar(key, operation):
            performs encryption or decryption of the letters in text files
